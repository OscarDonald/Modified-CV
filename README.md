Project Title: Modified CV-page

Hello and welcome to my modern CV page! My name is Oscar Donaldson, and I'm excited to present the project where I've created a personal CV page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Technical Aspects:

HTML:
I utilized HTML to structure and organize the content on the page. Employing semantic tags such as <header>, <section>, and <nav>, I established a clear and easily readable structure.

CSS:
To give the page an attractive and cohesive design, I employed CSS. I implemented responsive design to ensure the CV page looks great on various screen sizes and devices. Custom styles and layout choices were made thoughtfully to reflect a professional image.

JavaScript:
To add interactivity and enhance the user experience, I integrated JavaScript. This included dynamically loading data and event handling to make the page more lively and engaging.

Functionality:

Dynamic Content:
Important information is loaded dynamically using JavaScript, creating a smoother user experience and minimizing page loading time.

Interactive Form:
An interactive contact form was implemented with validation to simplify communication between visitors and myself.

Custom Animation:
To give the page an extra touch of professionalism, I used custom animation to highlight certain elements and make transitions more elegant.

Conclusions:

This project not only showcases my technical proficiency in web development but also demonstrates my creativity and commitment to creating a CV page that is not only informative but also aesthetically pleasing. I am confident that this modern CV page will help me stand out and make a strong impression on potential employers.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my project!
